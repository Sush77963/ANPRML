Automatic Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR This project implements an end-to-end Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using the YOLOv8 object detection model and EasyOCR for text extraction. The pipeline detects vehicle license plates in images or videos and recognizes the plate numbers automatically.
